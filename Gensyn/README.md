## What is Gensyn?

**Gensyn** is a decentralized compute protocol designed for training machine learning models at scale‚Äîwithout relying on centralized infrastructure.

It creates a permissionless, trustless marketplace for ML compute where anyone can offer or request training power. The protocol ensures correctness of work using lightweight cryptographic proofs‚Äîmaking trust in centralized compute obsolete.

## Problems Gensyn Addresses

| Challenge                             | Gensyn's Approach                                      |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Centralized cloud lock-in             | Permissionless compute supply from global participants |
| Unverifiable off-chain training       | Cryptographic proof-of-training                        |
| High-cost model training              | Market-priced, decentralized compute                  |
| Inefficient global hardware usage     | Recruits idle GPUs through open participation          |
| Redundancy or full replication issues | Lightweight verification mechanisms                    |

## Protocol Architecture

### 1. Training Job Submission

Clients submit training tasks to the network, which include:
- Initial model weights
- Datasets or data loaders
- Optimizer configurations
- Target objectives / checkpoints

These are dispatched into a peer-to-peer marketplace for available compute nodes to pick up.

---

### 2. Verifiable Execution

To avoid re-running expensive ML jobs for verification, Gensyn implements **proof-of-training** mechanisms:
- Commitments to weight updates
- Cryptographic traces of training correctness
- (Future) Zero-Knowledge Proofs for full training integrity

This allows the network to **validate** results with minimal overhead.

---

### 3. Decentralized Marketplace

Gensyn runs a dynamic market where:
- Clients publish jobs + budget
- Workers submit bids and run training
- Only valid proofs are paid
- Slashing is enforced on incorrect or malicious workers

Payments and enforcement are handled by smart contracts.

---

### 4. Parallelism & Fault Tolerance

To support scalable model training:
- Tasks are sharded across multiple nodes
- Aggregation mechanisms combine weight updates
- Faulty or dropped nodes are dynamically replaced
- The protocol handles training continuity and convergence

---

## Core Design Principles

- **Trustless Compute**  
  No reliance on third-party validators or off-chain trust assumptions.

- **Economic Efficiency**  
  Nodes compete in an open market; pricing is driven by supply/demand.

- **Scalability**  
  Supports parallelized ML training across distributed nodes with low coordination overhead.

- **Incentive Alignment**  
  Honest compute is rewarded. Cheating provably fails‚Äîor gets slashed.
