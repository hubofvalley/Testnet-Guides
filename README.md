This repo section has guides and scripts for the testnet nodes I run. If you want to try out testnet setups, feel free to use anything here.

## Grand Valley

I'm Grand Valley, and I run validator nodes on several testnets to help test new features and support the ecosystem. Here’s what I’m working on:

### 0g (zero-gravity) Testnet
- Running a validator on the 0g testnet (decentralized AI/data availability).
- Public endpoints I provide:
  - cosmos rpc: `https://lightnode-rpc-0g.grandvalleys.com`
  - json-rpc: `https://lightnode-json-rpc-0g.grandvalleys.com`
  - cosmos rest-api: `https://lightnode-api-0g.grandvalleys.com`
  - peer: `65f62fc8e46ff89f7960bc30e2fc1c0e4a846340@peer-0g.grandvalleys.com:26656`
- If you want to delegate or test, you can find my validator in the testnet explorer or reach out for details.
- I keep the node monitored and updated, aiming for high uptime and quick support.

### Story Protocol Testnet
- Running a validator on Story Protocol testnet (protocol for creative works and IP on-chain).
- Public endpoints I provide:
  - cosmos rpc: `https://lightnode-rpc-story.grandvalleys.com`
  - json-rpc: `https://lightnode-json-rpc-story.grandvalleys.com`
  - cosmos rest-api: `https://lightnode-api-story.grandvalleys.com`
  - cosmos ws: `wss://lightnode-rpc-story.grandvalleys.com/websocket`
  - evm ws: `wss://lightnode-wss-story.grandvalleys.com`
- You can delegate to my validator or use the endpoints for your own node/app.
- I keep things stable and try to help the community where I can.

## How I Work

- I monitor all my nodes 24/7 and try to fix issues fast.
- If you have questions, want to delegate, or need help with setup, just ask.
- Everything here is based on my real configs and experience.

## Guides

Check the folders for step-by-step instructions. Scripts and endpoints are the same ones I use for my own testnet nodes.
