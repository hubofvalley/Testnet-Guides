# KiteAI

## What Is KiteAI?

KiteAI is a sample documentation/testnet guide for a lightweight model-serving and dataset management stack designed for demonstration and local development. This repository contains instructions, scripts, and sample configuration to run KiteAI services locally or in CI/CD.

## Architecture

KiteAI is composed of:

- Model inference service (REST/gRPC)
- Dataset storage and ingestion utilities
- Simple web dashboard for status and example queries
- CI pipelines for building, testing, and publishing Docker images

## Components

- api/: Model inference API (Python/Flask or Node.js)
- dashboard/: Minimal static frontend for demos
- data/: Example datasets and ingestion scripts
- docker/: Docker-related manifests and helper scripts
- ci/: CI configuration (GitHub Actions)

## Use Cases

- Local development and smoke-testing model-serving workflows
- Integration testing of model pipelines
- Educational guide to deploy a simple model service and client

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repository

   git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git

2. Copy environment variables:

   cp .env.example .env

3. Build and run with Docker Compose:

   docker compose up --build

4. Open the dashboard at http://localhost:8080 and the API at http://localhost:8000

## Running the KiteAI Service Locally

The repository includes a lightweight Python API and a small frontend. To run locally without Docker:

- Install dependencies (see [Development](#development))
- Start the API server:

   make run-api

- Start the frontend:

   make run-frontend

## Configuration

All runtime configuration is provided via environment variables. See [`.env.example`](.env.example:1) for the canonical list of settings. Replace placeholders with real values before running in production.

Key variables:

- KITEAI_API_PORT - port the API listens on (default 8000)
- KITEAI_LOG_LEVEL - log verbosity
- KITEAI_MODEL_PATH - path or URL to the model artifact

## Development

- Install dependencies:

   make install

- Run linters and formatters:

   make lint

- Run unit tests:

   make test

## Testing

The repository includes a basic pytest (or jest) test suite for the API and utility modules. Tests can be run with:

   make test

## Deployment

This project provides a Dockerfile and a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and pushes images to a container registry. Update CI secrets for registry credentials.

## Contributing
