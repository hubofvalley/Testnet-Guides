**Last Updated:** 21/02/2025

This Privacy Policy applies to all tools, scripts, guides, and RPC endpoints ("Services") created and maintained by Grand Valley, accessible via GitHub repositories and other platforms under the Grand Valley account.

## 1. Data Collection
We do not intentionally collect or store personal data from users of our Services. However, automated systems (e.g., RPC endpoints) may temporarily log:
- IP addresses for security and debugging purposes.
- Network requests and responses (excluding sensitive data like private keys).
- Device/browser information (e.g., user-agent headers).

## 2. Use of Data
Data is used solely for:
- Maintaining and improving Services.
- Preventing abuse or malicious activity.
- Diagnosing technical issues.

## 3. Third-Party Sharing
We do not sell or share data with third parties, except:
- When required by law.
- To service providers (e.g., hosting providers) strictly necessary for operating the Services.

## 4. Data Protection
We implement industry-standard security measures, but no system is 100% secure. Use our Services at your own risk.

## 5. Your Rights
You may request deletion of incidental logs linked to your IP address by contacting us (see Section 7).

## 6. Changes to This Policy
Updates will be posted in this repository. Continued use of Services implies acceptance of changes.
