# Privacy Policy for Grand Valley Testnet Tools and Services  
**Last Updated:** 22/02/2025  

This Privacy Policy applies to all tools, scripts, guides, and RPC endpoints ("Services") created and maintained by Grand Valley, accessible via GitHub repositories and other platforms under the Grand Valley account.  

---

## 1. Strict No-Data-Collection Policy  
**We do not collect, store, process, or log any data from users of our Services.** This includes, but is not limited to:  
- **IP addresses** (we explicitly disable IP logging at both software and infrastructure levels)  
- Device/browser identifiers (e.g., user-agent headers, screen resolution)  
- Network metadata (requests, responses, timestamps)  
- Wallet addresses, private keys, or transaction data  
- Geolocation or demographic information  

---

## 2. Third-Party Services  
Our Services do not integrate with third-party analytics, tracking, or monitoring tools.  

**Note:** While we collect no data, platforms like GitHub may log interactions with repositories (e.g., cloning code). For details, review [GitHub's Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/privacy-policy).  

---

## 3. Security  
We employ security measures like code audits and dependency scanning to protect our Services. Since **no data is collected**, there is no risk of user data breaches.  

---

## 4. Your Rights  
Our zero-data-collection design inherently protects your privacy. There is no mechanism to request data deletion because no data exists.  

---

## 5. Policy Updates  
Changes will be posted in this repository. Continued use of Services constitutes acceptance.
