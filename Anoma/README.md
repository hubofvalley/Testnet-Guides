# Anoma: Intent-Centric Architecture for Decentralized Applications

![Grand Valley x Anoma](resources/gvxanoma.gif)

Anoma introduces a pioneering intent-centric architecture designed to revolutionize decentralized applications (dApps). By focusing on the fundamental primitive of intent, Anoma breaks free from the constraints of traditional blockchain-centric architectures, offering a more flexible and scalable solution for a wide range of applications.

## Key Concepts

### Intents

An intent is an expression of an individualâ€™s desired end state(s). Whether it's a simple transaction like buying a coffee or a complex operation like voting in a quadratic funding round, all applications involve intents.

### Decentralized Intent-Completion Mechanisms

Existing decentralized intent-completion mechanisms are application-specific. Anoma aims to generalize this process, enabling any intent to be completed efficiently.

### Intent-Centric Architecture

An intent-centric architecture prioritizes intents over blockchain transactions. This approach provides the properties necessary for decentralized applications, including generalized intents, counterparty discovery, solving, and settlement.

## Architecture Overview

### Generalized Intents

Anoma processes arbitrary intents, eliminating the need for application-specific configurations. This flexibility allows for a wide range of applications to be built on a single, cohesive framework.

### Counterparty Discovery

A decentralized process through which individual intents can be gossiped around and accessed by solvers, ensuring that the right parties are connected for intent completion.

### Solving

A decentralized process where intents are combined and computed into valid solutions (transactions) that can be settled. This ensures that all intents are addressed efficiently.

### Settlement

Verification and finalization of solutions on-chain, providing a secure and transparent process for all transactions.

## Benefits of Intent-Centric Architecture

### Properties for Existing dApps

Anoma provides all the necessary properties for existing decentralized applications:

- Generalized intents
- Counterparty discovery
- Solving
- Settlement

### Novel Properties

Anoma introduces novel properties that can enable innovative dApps:

- Local and global scalability
- Information flow control
- Configurable ordering
- Configurable settlement
- Compositional identity

### Declarative Paradigm

Anoma enforces a declarative paradigm for applications, allowing users to define their desired end states clearly. This approach results in market structures that are as decentralized as possible, subject to exogenous constraints.

---

## Use Cases

### Simplified Payments

Simple applications like payments can be enabled with a single intent, making transactions straightforward and efficient.

### Complex Applications

More complex applications, such as quadratic funding, combinatorial auctions, and Game B economic systems, can also be facilitated with well-defined intents.

## Compatibility and Flexibility

### Compatibility with Blockchain-Centric Architectures

Anoma is compatible with existing blockchain-centric architectures and can be used in various ways, including:

- **L1**: As a standalone layer 1 blockchain
- **L1.5**: Combining intent-centric properties with settlement on another sovereign chain
- **L2**: As a rollup or state transition layer borrowing security from another blockchain

### Generalizability Across Security Models

Anoma's intent-centric architecture is generalizable across different security models, enabling applications to operate seamlessly across various domains without being locked into a single blockchain.

---

## Conclusion

Anoma represents a significant advancement in decentralized application design, offering a flexible and scalable solution that can accommodate a wide range of applications. By focusing on intents rather than blockchain transactions, Anoma unlocks new possibilities for decentralized systems, much like how Ethereum introduced programmable settlement to the Bitcoin ecosystem. The potential applications and innovations enabled by Anoma are vast and yet to be fully explored.
