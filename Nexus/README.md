# Nexus Testnet Guide

Nexus is building the **modular coordination layer for Ethereum**, designed to optimise capital allocation and governance across onchain systems. With a shared coordination infrastructure, Nexus aims to simplify how different modules (DA, Execution, Settlement, etc.) interact through *incentivised coordination markets* and *secure signalling mechanisms*.

This guide will help you participate in the Nexus testnet as a validator or node operator, providing step-by-step instructions curated by Grand Valley.

## About Nexus

> Nexus provides a general-purpose signalling layer that enables protocols to express preferences and make credible commitments.

The core innovation of Nexus lies in separating *coordination* from *execution* and *settlement*. Rather than reinvent consensus, Nexus builds a lightweight, modular layer that focuses on aggregating signals, preferences, and commitments from many actors â€” both human and automated â€” across the modular stack.

### Core Components

- **Signal Layer**  
  A cryptoeconomic mechanism that allows actors (individuals, protocols, or DAOs) to submit, aggregate, and validate preferences. Designed to work across heterogeneous domains, both onchain and offchain.

- **Schelling Coordination Markets**  
  Bonded commitments incentivised through Schelling-point alignment. Honest participation is rewarded, while dishonest signalling can be slashed, ensuring credible aggregation.

- **Coordinator Network**  
  A decentralised network of validators who aggregate and attest to signals. This network ensures liveness, accuracy, and availability of coordination data for integrated ecosystems.

- **Use Case Agnostic**  
  Nexus is designed as infrastructure. It can be used for:
  - Rollup governance signals
  - L2 block proposer selection
  - Liquidity migration votes
  - Reputation scoring
  - Cross-chain intent signalling

## Join the Nexus Testnet

Nexus has entered **Testnet III** â€“ the most community-focused phase yet. Validators can participate, signal preferences, run nodes, and contribute to testing the coordination mechanisms.

**Official Launch Post:**  
https://blog.nexus.xyz/community-tldr-testnet-iii-launch-edition/

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:
- Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- 2+ vCPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB SSD
- Basic knowledge of CLI, Docker, and Ethereum infra
- Git, Go (if required), Node.js (optional for frontend tools)

---

## Installation & Node Setup

_This section will be updated with actual installation steps once Nexus publishes the testnet client code or Docker image._

Tasks to prepare for:
- Clone the Nexus node repo (TBA)
- Generate keys or import validator keys
- Set up environment configs
- Join the peer network
- Start signalling and validate commitments

---

## Validator Responsibilities

Validators in Nexus are expected to:
- Maintain uptime to ensure liveness
- Participate in Schelling games (bond-slash system)
- Relay and validate signals from various domains (e.g., DA layers, execution chains)
- Secure the signalling layer integrity

Rewards and slashing will depend on participation quality in Schelling markets.
