# Seismic: The Encrypted Blockchain

![alt text](resources/image.png)

Seismic is a pioneering blockchain platform that integrates robust encryption directly into its protocol, ensuring privacy and security for all users. By embedding encryption at the system's core, Seismic enables developers to create innovative financial applications, investment vehicles, and social experiences that were previously limited by transparency constraints.

## Key Features

- **Encrypted Global State**: Facilitates secure interactions among multiple users, essential for applications like exchanges and lending platforms.
- **Encrypted Memory Access**: Supports encrypted pointers, crucial for functionalities such as auctions and stablecoins.
- **Encrypted Data Flow**: Manages controlled exchanges between encrypted and transparent states, vital for applications ranging from organizational tools to launchpads.

## Getting Started

To begin developing with Seismic, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Set up your local development environment by installing necessary tools like `sforge`, `sanvil`, and `ssolc`. Detailed instructions are available in the [Installation Guide](https://docs.seismic.systems/onboarding/publish-your-docs).

2. **Quickstart**: Deploy a sample contract to familiarize yourself with Seismic's capabilities. Refer to the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.seismic.systems/onboarding/quickstart) for step-by-step instructions.

3. **Tutorial**: Build and deploy the Walnut App, a Seismic-powered shielded contract game. The [Tutorial](https://docs.seismic.systems/onboarding/tutorial) provides comprehensive guidance through the process.

## Core Concepts

Understanding Seismic's foundational elements is crucial for effective development:

- **Data Types**: Learn about `suint`, `sint`, `saddress`, and `sbool` to handle various data operations securely.
- **Collections**: Explore how to manage groups of data efficiently within the Seismic framework.
- **Clients**: Understand the client structures to interact seamlessly with the Seismic network.

For an in-depth exploration, refer to the [Core Concepts](https://docs.seismic.systems/core/basics) section in the documentation.
